# Chat + Coding Challenge Application

## Objectives

### Enhance Learning Through Community Interaction
Create a collaborative environment where programmers can communicate, share resources, and assist each other in real-time. This aims to enhance the learning process through community interaction.

### Integrate Competitive Programming
Facilitate one-on-one coding battles using a library of coding problems from Codeforces. Users can challenge friends and peers in real-time competitions, improving coding skills under pressure.

### Develop Real-Time Communication Channels
Implement a multi-room chat application that supports various programming topics and languages. Users can join conversations relevant to their interests and skills.

### Build with Scalable and Robust Technologies
Develop the platform using scalable and robust technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO. This ensures the application can handle high volumes of real-time data and user interactions without performance degradation.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication library

## Features
- Real-time chat rooms for various programming topics
- One-on-one coding battles with Codeforces problems
- User profiles and interaction tracking
- Scalable infrastructure to support high user volume
